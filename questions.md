1. Can change some attributes of order to nullable?

2. e.g. in asg write up, DeliveryDateTime: DateTime
   but DeliveryDateTime is not defined until Customer pays and Restaurant accepts order

3. In CreateOrder(), it says to "prompt the user to enter the special request, only 1 is allowed" but in the diagram, there is only a "customise" attribute for the FoodItem. how will we know which foodItem to count this under?
