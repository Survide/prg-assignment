1. Can change some attributes of order to nullable?

2. In CreateOrder(), it says to "prompt the user to enter the special request, only 1 is allowed" but in the diagram, there is only a "customise" attribute for the FoodItem. how will we know which foodItem to count this under?

3. For feature 7, "modify an existing order", does modifying items only allow u to increase/decrease the quantity? what should happen if you decrease the quantity? or will it prompt you to add more items/delete more items?

4. For feature 7, do we have to write back to csv file after modifying?

5. In feature 6, theres a Refund Stack. When and where will that be used? Will it be functional and return customer their money? or is it just for decoration?

6. In feature 6, if skipping order and check of order status is "Cancelled".
    Do we need to modify order to "Cancelled"? technically by 'skipping', just means leave it unhandled.

7. Are helper functions allowed?
