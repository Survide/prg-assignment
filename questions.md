1. Can change some attributes of order to nullable?

2. In CreateOrder(), it says to "prompt the user to enter the special request, only 1 is allowed" but in the diagram, there is only a "customise" attribute for the FoodItem. how will we know which foodItem to count this under?

3. For feature 7, "modify an existing order", does modifying items only allow u to increase/decrease the quantity? what should happen if you decrease the quantity? or will it prompt you to add more items/delete more items?

4. For feature 7, do we have to write back to csv file after modifying?
