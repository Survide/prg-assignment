can change some attributes of order to nullable?
e.g. in asg write up, DeliveryDateTime: DateTime
but DeliveryDateTime is not defined until Customer pays and Restaurant accepts order

what's OrderPaymentMethod

In CreateOrder(), it says to "prompt the user to enter the special request, only 1 is allowed" but in the diagram, there is only a "customise" attribute for the FoodItem. how will we know which foodItem to count this under?
